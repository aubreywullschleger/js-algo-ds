# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns/Strategies

## Basic Approach
  - What is an Algorithm?
    - a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
      - ex: mathematical steps to solve a math problem, calculate 1st 100 prime numbers
  - Why do I need to know this?
    -  almost everything we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
    -  it's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
    -  also interviews!
  - How do you improve?
    - devise a plan for solving problems
    - master common problem solving patterns
  
  - ### Problem solving strategies:
    - most of these strategies are from _How To Solve It_ by George Polya
    1. Understand the Problem
       1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
       2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
       3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
       4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough info to solve the problem? (you may not be able to answer this question until you start solving the problem, but it's still worth it to consider early on)
       5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
    2. Explore Concrete Examples
    3. Break it Down
    4. Solve/Simplify
    5. Look Back and Refactor
