# Built-in Data Structures through lens of Big-O

Objects

- unorderd, key value pairs
- When to use objects/when they work well
  - when you don't need order
  - when you need fast access/insertion and removal
- Big O of Objects
  - Insertion --> O(1)
  - Removal --> O(1)
  - Searching --> O(n)
  - Access --> O(1)
- Big O of Object Methods
  - Object.keys --> O(n)
  - Object.values --> O(n)
  - Object.entries --> O(n)
  - hasOwnProperty --> O(1)
