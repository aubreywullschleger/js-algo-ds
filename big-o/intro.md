Why do we need Big-O Notation??
  - How do we know what the best way to solve a problem is out of the numerous solves it has?
  - big-o is a way to compare/classify the different solves to a programming problem/code performance
  - big-o gives us a numeric representation of the performance of code
  
  - Why does it matter what's best?
    - depending on context/project the best solution may be to just get the code to work
    - otherwise (interviews/large project/lots of data - where performance matters), we need the vocab to talk about code performance
    - useful for talking about trade-offs between approaches
    - identifying inefficient code/applications
