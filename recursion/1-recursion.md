# Recursion

- Another way to solve problems non-iterative, but recursively

### Why use Recursion?

- What is recursion

  - A process (a function in our case) that calls itself

- Why know this
  - it's everywhere
  - JSON.parse/stringify
  - document.getElementById, and DOM traversal algos
  - object traversal
  - we will see it w/ more complex data structures
  - it's sometimes cleaner vs iteration
